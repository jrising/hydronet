Plan to construct a better hydrological model, able to take as input:
  * D-infinity angles and slopes (from Taudem)
  * Daily precipitation data
  * Daily temperature data
  * Snow/Ice cover data

[But how would I validate it?  The Bhakra data.  But how can I model it
without it being validated?  Incrementally.]

Basin-finding:
    Working with Taudem.  But need automated GIS shape file construction of outlets.

Channel-rate:
    

Max year volumes:
    Determine 2 year flood peak: Find yearly maximum, 2 year peak is median.   
    For figuring out contribution of flows to flood, consider volume
    of flood + volume of threshold over floodtime.

Distributions:
